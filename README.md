Application of Toeplitz Matrix for Audio Smoothening


Data preprocessing is not well regarded when using deep neural networks for
training. Many often throw in inputs to model architecture and hope to get desirable
outcome. In this work, we reimplemented Dai et al. proposed architectures for
acoustic raw waveform and propose a prior preprocessing with toeplitz matrix. We
revealed better performance with the preprocessing step. Our computations shows
high reliance on computational memory and speed.
